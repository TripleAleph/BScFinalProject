                    "How many times a day your dog needs to eat depends on several factors, like his age, activity level and overall health.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Having a feeding schedule and routine can help you stay on track and plan for your day. Let’s look at how many times a day a dog should eat, how to create a feeding schedule based on his individual needs and the best time to feed a dog.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "What is a Dog Feeding Schedule?\n" +
                    "If you’re picturing an elaborate calendar, don’t worry. That’s not what a dog feeding schedule is. Your dog’s feeding schedule is simply the regular times at which you feed him on a daily basis.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Feeding him at the same time (or close to it) each day helps keep his digestive system regular and makes his need to go outside more predictable. This schedule also helps your dog learn when to expect you home, so he’ll have fewer accidents.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "How Often Should You Feed a Dog?\n" +
                    "Before you create a schedule, you need to figure out how often your dog should eat. This depends on several factors, including his age, activity level and general health.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The type of food you select can help you determine how much to feed him and how often. Refer to the serving suggestions on your dog’s food label and compare it to his breed size and age.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "This will give you a better idea about how much your dog should eat each day. Once you know this, you can divide that amount into two or more meals.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The frequency of feeding depends on your schedule. If you’re home during the day, you may prefer feeding three meals a day. If you work outside the home, it may be more convenient to feed him twice per day.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "As you develop your dog’s feeding schedule, pay attention to his preferences as well. He may prefer three smaller meals rather than two larger ones, or vice versa.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "What is the Best Time to Feed a Dog?\n" +
                    "Again, this depends on your schedule, but you should also consider your dog’s age and activity level. Just as you wouldn’t want to eat a large meal before going to the gym, your dog shouldn’t eat right before or after exercising. This can lead to a life-threatening condition called bloat, particularly in large breed dogs.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "If you still aren’t sure about how often you should feed your dog, ask your veterinarian. They know your dog and can tell you how much he should eat and when, based on his age, health, activity level and more.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Your veterinarian may also offer tips to improve your dog’s eating habits. For example, if your dog eats too fast, they may suggest changes to help him slow down.",

                    "One of the most popular holiday gifts, whether for a romantic partner or child, is a puppy. The holiday break may be a good time to adopt a pet from a shelter if family members are home and willing to spend time training and socializing. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Before giving a dog as a gift, there are several things to consider, which we’ll outline below. Then, if you decide it’s still a good idea to gift someone a dog over the holidays, we have advice on the best way to do so. Remember, the ultimate goal is to match the recipient with the right dog, and ensure they have the means to care for him.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "3 Things to Consider Before Giving a Dog as a Gift\n" +
                    "1. What the Recipient Wants\n" +
                    "It’s best to ask the recipient outright whether they want a dog, but that ruins the element of surprise. So, be diligent and do your homework.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Even if they love dogs, consider why they don’t currently have one. They may have a good reason, like working long hours. Some can’t afford the unexpected costs that often come with pet ownership, like veterinarian bills, medications and more.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "2. Their Lifestyle\n" +
                    "Lifestyle is another important consideration to ensure the recipient and dog are a good match. If the person is active, they may want an energetic dog to go for runs or long walks.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "On the other hand, if the dog will be a companion for your elderly grandmother, a calm and relaxed pup is a better choice. Other lifestyle factors to consider include whether the recipient does a lot of traveling or if there are children or other pets involved.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "3. Home Environment\n" +
                    "Even small dogs need room to play, and all dogs need an outdoor space to go to the bathroom. Consider the size and location of the recipient’s home, whether they have a yard and if it’s fenced.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "If they live in an apartment with little to no outdoor space, a small dog may be better than a large breed. Environment, lifestyle and the recipient’s own desires will dictate the type of dog that’s best.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "How to Give a Dog as a Gift\n" +
                    "If you’ve considered all the above and still think giving a dog as a gift is a good idea, you need to choose the best way to give him to the recipient. Placing a puppy in a box with holes poked in it and wrapped up under the tree isn’t a good option. It’s dangerous and traumatic for the dog. You can maintain an element of surprise without doing this.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Rather than putting the dog under the tree, buy a dog toy, stuffed dog, or supplies like a leash and collar or food bowls and wrap those instead. When the recipient opens the gift(s), tell them your intentions to get them a dog and explain you’ll pay the adoption fee.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "This allows them to pick the dog out themselves at a more convenient time, such as after the holidays. They can start their search on Petfinder.com to find the perfect dog at a shelter or rescue near them.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "If you plan to give a dog as a gift this holiday season, set the recipient up for success as a new dog owner. In addition to paying the adoption fee, offer to pay for the pup’s first checkup or stock them up on dog or puppy food. \n" +

                    "You’re not the only one who suffers from dry skin in the winter. When the heat comes on more frequently in the house, your pet may also become itchy. Unless your dog or cat is continually scratching himself, dry skin is not a serious health issue. But you can’t just wash the problem away. In fact, bathing your pet can make the problem worse. So if you do need to shampoo your pet, make sure to apply a moisturizer afterwards.\n" +

                    "For larger breeds, they may not reach maturity until between 18 months and 2 years of age. Once puppies wean off their mothers’ milk around eight weeks of age, they transition to puppy food.\n" +

                    "Puppy food is specially formulated to meet the needs of growing pups. It has more calories than adult dog food and proper levels of essential nutrients, including vitamins and minerals puppies need to develop healthy immune systems, strong bones and more.\n" +

                    "Nutritional Requirements for Puppies\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "Protein: Puppies need more dietary protein and more essential amino acids than adult dogs to support their rapid growth and development. Some adult dog foods may have similar protein levels, but it’s important to note that they may not have the appropriate levels of other essential nutrients puppies need.\n" +
                    "Fat: High-energy puppies use fat as an energy source and need higher levels of essential fatty acids for rapid growth and development. Fat also ensures fat-soluble vitamins are properly absorbed by the body. Puppy foods often contain higher fat than adult dog foods.\n" +
                    "Calcium: As it does for humans, calcium helps puppies develop strong bones and teeth. Calcium requirements for large and giant breeds are different than those of toy, small and medium breeds. For this reason, it’s important to choose a puppy food formulated for your dog’s breed size.\n" +
                    "Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are another energy source for puppies. Carbs get broken down before protein or fat. Carbs are also a good source of fiber, which helps support the digestive health.\n" +
                    "DHA: This omega-3 fatty acid supports brain and vision development in puppies. A puppy’s first source of DHA is his mother’s milk. Once weaned, they rely on their diet to supply this essential nutrient. It’s most often sourced from fish or fish oil.\n" +

                    "Your puppy’s upset stomach could be the result of several things. Because puppies start teething around 12 weeks of age and use their mouths as a sensory organ for learning, they chew on and may accidentally swallow many things they shouldn’t, like sticks, leaves, furniture, shoes and more.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Being diligent about feeding only puppy food and treats can avoid upsetting his stomach with human food snacks. Foods high in fat and spices, like steak and pizza, can wreak havoc on his digestive tract.  Other foods, like grapes and chocolate, can be toxic to your puppy. If your puppy does get into something that might be unsafe, it’s best to call your veterinarian.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Sometimes, puppies get so excited about the delicious puppy food we offer them that they eat it too fast. This may lead to the food coming back up or excess gas forming in the intestines. Both can be uncomfortable for your puppy.\n" +

                    "Puppies are a lot of work. They need constant supervision and entertainment. Otherwise, they’ll get bored, and bored puppies will find ways to entertain themselves, which can involve chewing on things like your new shoes, chair legs or other objects around the house.\n" +

                    "If your puppy manages to break off pieces and swallow whatever he’s chewing on (even toys), they could potentially cause GI upset, damage or even potential blockage in the stomach or intestines. Watch for symptoms like bloody stool, vomiting, inability to defecate, low energy and even weight loss.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "If you suspect your puppy has eaten any of those foods, call your veterinarian to find out what to do. They may have you watch for symptoms like decreased appetite, vomiting and/or diarrhea, abdominal tenderness and lethargy or weakness. They may also recommend bringing him in for an exam or advise you to induce vomiting. Do not induce vomiting if your puppy is struggling to breathe.\n" +

                    "Your puppy’s immune system is still developing, so it’s important to avoid public places like dog parks, pet stores and pet-friendly restaurants until he has had all his vaccines and boosters. Infections can spread easily in these places. Your puppy can play with other vaccinated dogs in a safe place, like your backyard, to limit exposure to infectious viruses and bacteria.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Focus on socializing him with people and children of all ages and exposing him to a variety of experiences like a bicycle riding by, the postal carrier delivering mail or a plane flying overhead. This can result in a calmer, more well-adjusted adult dog. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Intestinal parasites are another potential cause of GI upset for your puppy. Puppies can become infected with the parasites from a number of places – from birth, the dirt, other animals, standing water, etc. Regular deworming and fecal exams by your veterinarian can help keep your puppy safe from infection.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Another serious and highly contagious infection that can cause severe stomach upset is parvovirus. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your puppy shows symptoms of parvo, including loss of appetite, abdominal pain and bloating, vomiting and diarrhea, which may be bloody. The positive news is that with regular vaccinations and boosters, your puppy can be protected from this virus.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "The ideal time to start house-training puppies is as soon as you bring them home, which for most people is between 8 to 12 weeks. While your puppy may have to go potty frequently (and there may be more accidents), establishing a routine early is important. By 12 to 16 weeks, your pet should have more bladder and bowel control.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "“Remember, it’s never too late to potty train,” says Dr. McGowan. “If your pet joined your family as an adult dog, it may take a bit longer to transition them away from old habits, depending on their past experiences.”\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Take them right to the area outside where you want them to go potty. Let them sniff around and get familiar with the area and give lots of praise as a reward immediately when they go potty in that spot. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "“Make a big production out of it with verbal cues like ‘good potty!’ and an excited tone of voice and/or give them some tasty treats,” recommends Dr. McGowan. “The more excited you are about your puppy going potty outside, the quicker they’ll learn it’s a good thing.”\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "What is the Best Way to Potty Train a Puppy?\n" +
                    "If you want to know how to house-train a puppy, remember consistency, attentiveness and patience are key. Establishing a routine will make potty breaks more predictable for your puppy, and they’ll learn when to expect to go outside.\n" +

                    "Watching them for cues when they need to go out will also help minimize the chances for accidents in the house. Remember to keep things positive and fun.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "“It can be helpful to use a crate, set up a special room like a portion of a bathroom or laundry room blocked off with baby gates, or keep your pup on a leash near you so they don’t wander off and have an accident while you’re distracted,” she advises.\n" +

                    "When you can’t watch your puppy, restrict them to a small enough area so they won’t want to eliminate there.”\n" +

                    "As you both become more established in your routine and your puppy learns to go potty outside only, you can gradually give them more freedom to roam around your house.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "As you’re creating your puppy potty-training schedule, keep this in mind: Age typically corresponds to the number of hours of control. This means if your puppy is three months old, don’t expect them to hold it for more than three hours—but this is just a general rule of thumb.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "“Keep in mind that every puppy is an individual. So, it’s best to take your puppy out every 30 to 60 minutes until you learn how long they can really hold it and work up from there.”\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Here are a few times of the day to let your puppy out as you begin potty training: \n" +

                    "As soon as they wake up from naps during the day \n" +

                    "After spending time in their crate\n" +
                    "Remember to take them outside to the same spot each time, as their scent may prompt them to go, and use the phrase “go potty” to encourage them.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Always stay with them outside, at least until they’re fully potty trained (yes, even if it is raining!). This way, you can ensure they actually go, and reward them for going outside.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "During training, praise them or give a treat each time they go outside. Using this positive reinforcement will encourage this behavior.\n" +

                    "Signs a Puppy Needs to Pee\n" +
                    "Every puppy is unique, so yours may follow some of these behaviors, but not others. Knowing the possibilities and learning which signals your puppy uses to tell you they need to go potty will help make training go more smoothly.\n" +

                    "Expect your puppy to have a few accidents in the house. It’s a normal part of house-training. Here’s what Dr. McGowan recommends doing when they happen:\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "“If you catch them in the act, interrupt them! Make noise, clap your hands or say ‘Outside!’ then immediately take them to their potty spot. Praise them and give them a treat if they finish outside.”\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "“Never punish your puppy for eliminating in the house. If you find a soiled area, it’s too late to try to correct the behavior. Just clean it up and move on.”\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "“Clean the soiled area thoroughly. Puppies are highly motivated to continue soiling in areas that smell like urine or feces.” \n" +

                    "It’s also not uncommon for puppies to regress for periods of time, so it’s important to be patient. Go back to taking them out more often and reinforcing their successes.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "Urinating in the same spot: If your dog has an accident inside and then continues to relieve themselves in that spot, you need a more effective cleaning solution. Look for an enzymatic cleanser to eliminate the odor and make the location less appealing. \n" +
                    "Going all over the house: There are a couple of possible reasons why your puppy keeps peeing in the house. First, you may have given them too much freedom too soon. If that’s the case, go back to a more restricted area for several days. Small and toy breeds struggle with bladder control longer, so you may need to take them out more often to help get the hang of things. Urinary tract infections may also affect bladder control. \n" +
                    "Soiling in their crate: If your dog is soiling in their crate, the crate may be too big, in which case you either need to downsize or get a pet-safe partition to decrease the available space. If, however, your dog came from a pet store or shelter where they spent most of their time confined to small spaces and had no other place to eliminate, crate training will take more time. Patience, persistence and consistency are key to helping them learn.\n" +
                    "There are many commands puppies need to learn to become good canine citizens, such as “sit,” “stay” and “heel.” “Go potty!” is just as important.\n" +

                    "Potty training is at the top of every new pet owner’s priority list. The sooner your puppy is potty trained, the happier everyone will be. Using these tips will help the process go smoothly.\n" +
